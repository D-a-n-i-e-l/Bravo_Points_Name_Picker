# Bravo_Points_Name_Picker
Another one of my first projects. A non-trivial tool for Program Managers on my team.

# Backstory
At my company, to incentivize beta testers, we hold a drawing for 'bravo' points. These points are redeemable for gifts on an internal website. I had noticed that the PM's that were in charge of picking names were using a childlike application from the internet. I had an idea to create a local tool that they can use instead.


# Problems
This was more of a practice of what I was learning at the moment. The first iteration did not remove the names of the winners(if the PM was picking more than one tester). This presented an issue when two of the same names got picked for points. To eliminate this, I added a pop() to the list once the name was selected. 

# Results
Several PM's use this tool now everyweek. They claim it works fine and gets the job done.
